more comfortable.

The Munchee can be submerged in freshly boiled water for 60 seconds to sterilise. <br><br>\r\n                            Ensure the Munchee is placed in the mouth with the \"lips\" indent at the top.\r\n                            Always keep the lips closed around the Munchee while chewing, this not only strengthens the muscles, it prevents excessive wear on the appliance. <br><br>\r\n                            Keep your chewing even and on both sides, chewing excessively or exclusively on one side will weaken the Munchee.<br><br>\r\n                            Rinse after use in cold running water and dry thoroughly.\r\n                            Aim for 5mins of active chewing, twice a day as an ideal protocol\r\n\r\n                          </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div class=\"acc-wrap\">\r\n                            <input type=\"radio\" name=\"acc\" id=\"acc4\">\r\n                            <label for=\"acc4\"><i class=\"fa fa-music\"></i> How often do I need to use a Munchee?</label>\r\n                            <div class=\"acc-body\">\r\n                              At minimum, for general oral health and keeping muscles strong the Munchee works if you or your child can chew for 5 mins twice a day. For 18 months to 5-years change should be evident in about 4 weeks and chewing should continue for life.\r\n                           </div>\r\n                         </div>\r\n                         <div class=\"acc-wrap\">\r\n                            <input type=\"radio\" name=\"acc\" id=\"acc5\">\r\n                            <label for=\"acc5\"><i class=\"fa fa-music\"></i>How long will it last? </label>\r\n                            <div class=\"acc-body\">\r\n                              This depends on a few factors, but as a general rule a Munchee should last between 6-18 months with regular use. Those who are heavy chewers, teeth grinders or wear the Munchee more frequently than recommended may experience a shorter lifespan. Good care of the appliance is very important and it should be rinsed and dried after every use.\r\n                              If with regular use, your Munchee breaks in the first three months we will replace the device free of charge. \r\n                              <br><br>\r\n                              At minimum, for general oral health and keeping muscles strong the Munchee works if you or your child can chew for 5 mins twice a day.

The Munchee is a tool to assist with myofunctional needs, it is not designed as a stand-alone treatment but part of an arsenal that can assist you with correct oral rest posture, swallow pattern, tongue positioning and nasal breathing.\r\n                              <br><br>\r\n                              Tongue-tie, pacifier use and mouth breathing are 3 of the most common causes of this type of mal-occlusion. Be aware that this type of malocclusion is one that can cause damage to a Munchee due to the imbalance of forces through the jaw. \r\n                              It is essential for any child over the age of six years to work with a dental practitioner to achieve optimum outcomes. Begin with using the Munchee passively ensuring that lips are together at all times and build up to chewing very, very gently\r\n                              \r\n                           </div>\r\n                         </div>\r\n                         <div class=\"acc-wrap\">\r\n                            <input type=\"radio\" name=\"acc\" id=\"acc13\">\r\n                            <label for=\"acc13\"><i class=\"fa fa-music\"></i>What is passive use of the Munchee?</label>\r\n                            <div class=\"acc-body\">\r\n                              Passive use describes holding the Munchee in position in your mouth with lips sealed around the device. Breathing through the nose, ensure the tongue is positioned on the roof of the mouth. Allow the jaw to rest in this position, no chewing needs to occur with passive use.\r\n                           </div>\r\n                         </div>\r\n                         <div class=\"acc-wrap\">\r\n                            <input type=\"radio\" name=\"acc\" id=\"acc14\">\r\n                            <label for=\"acc14\"><i class=\"fa fa-music\"></i>Can the Munchee be used after orthodontic work?</label>\r\n                            <div class=\"acc-body\">\r\n                              The Munchee can be a very useful adjunct following orthodontic work.
